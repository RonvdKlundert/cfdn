DN CF processing pipeline:


GET pRF FITS:
1) get your fmriprep data and run it through preproc_baseline -> get right baselining
2) prf fitting on LISA with new_prf_fit_all.py/new_prf_fit_folds.py, export the data to lisa first of course (env: prf)
3) collect fits and transfer to node230, 're-assable' partition data to full data fits like in ECVP_figures (make separate notebook/script sooner or later to run this in 1 or a few lines)

DRAW ROI
1) add all the data with add_roi and make a static viewer to guide drawing
2) draw ROIs and save in a overlays.svg

FIT CF
1) make sure you have a good defined V1 for the fitting
2) use CF_processing to create your design matrices for each of the spaces beforehand. You need the surface in pycortex and pRF fits of at least V1 to create all of them
3) save myv1surf.subsurface verts as well
4) optional: create a mask for the fitting that only includes visual regions and excludes V1
5) transfer all the previous created utilities to LISA
6) Do CF fitting with 9_analyse.py
7) harvest results as in ECVP_figues
